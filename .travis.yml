# Let Travis know the services that needs to be installed
#   - We need a copy of docker
services:
    - docker

# This section has the commands to be executed before the test run (Similar to @BeforeTest in TestNG)
#   - The dev image needs to be built before exeucting the tests.
#   - Note: The context here is "./web-server" (due to position of .travis.yml) as against "." that is typically used.
#   - Here, we are building and running tests only for the web-server . Similarly, we can have tests for other s as well.
before_install:
  - docker build -f ./web-server/Dockerfile.dev -t raghubs81/multi-web-server-dev ./web-server

# This section has the commands to run the test suite. If any command exists with non-zero status, the build is considered broken.
# By default, "npm run test" is interractive and does not return a prompt, hence "-e CI=true" is required.
script:
  - docker run -e CI=true raghubs81/multi-web-server-dev npm run test

after_success:
  - docker build -t raghubs81/multi-web-server ./web-server
  - docker build -t raghubs81/multi-app-server ./app-server
  - docker build -t raghubs81/multi-worker     ./worker
  - docker build -t raghubs81/multi-lb         ./lb

  # Environment variables DOCKER_ID and DOCKER_PASSWORD are added -- https://travis-ci.com/raghubs81/docker-multi-container/settings
  # The command "docker login" asks for username/password and associates "docker" client with "docker hub" account. 
  #   - The following pipe automates the same (without user interaction).
  - echo "$DOCKER_PASSWORD" | docker login -u "$DOCKER_ID" --password-stdin

  # Now that we are authenticated to docker-hub account, we can push images.
  - docker push raghubs81/multi-web-server
  - docker push raghubs81/multi-app-server
  - docker push raghubs81/multi-worker
  - docker push raghubs81/multi-lb
